## Usage 

One may use this app to build a roster for their team or employee base. This provides a simple, easy way to create a good looking database of employees or whatever group you may be creating it for. It also provides a localized place to reference the rank, position, or personal information about the group or individuals in the group. The use of the app is quite simple: the user is prompted with a series of questions after running node and the answers are subsequently populated into a page. 

Below is an example of the output of the application.
